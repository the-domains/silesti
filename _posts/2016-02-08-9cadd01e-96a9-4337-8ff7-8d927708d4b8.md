350GT - My first project car, my first Skyline
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dbce6755-9210-43c8-8531-f24d5dc8908c.jpg)

This car ticked off a number of boxes for me. It was cheap (I mean REALLY cheap), it's a decent size - I'm 6'2" tall so I've got to fit in - it's a coupe but it's got 4 seats and it's even got a boot, it's 3.5 liters of v6 noise and the biggest tick... it's a Skyline!

So of course I'm going to do things to it..

* Bodywork update. Sills, front and rear bumpers
* Wheels
* Replace the Japanese import radio with a UK one (this means replacing the center console too)
* Interior lighting - the stock bulbs are, well they're bulbs, yellowish and boring.
* New numberplate - yes it's going to get personal...

In the fullness of time I might start playing with the engine, but it's cosmetics first and power later.
