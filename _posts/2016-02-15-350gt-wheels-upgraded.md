The stock wheels on the 350GT perform their function very well. They provide the mix of comfort and performance that you'd want to delivery as a factory, but not necessarily what you'd want to have as a driver!

Changing the wheels was on my list of modifications to the GT and the guys up at WheelMania (wheelmania.co.uk) were really helpful in getting not only the right fit, but the right look.
